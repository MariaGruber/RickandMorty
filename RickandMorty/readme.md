Hello! this is my Journal.

first thing I've got to admit is that I'm doing this last moment, but well, I'm doing everything last moment. So first I have to thank you for your patience, you must be sick of me being sick. Believe me, I am too.

I am going to take a comedy license here, mostly because it helps me feel better, and I really want to feel better right now. secondly, well because I think I actually am pretty funny, it is just that I'm not as good at talking as I am at writing. So, in the spirit of fairness I have to try.

So it all started Monday, Alberto walked me through his project with the kindness of a loving father talking to his son, and all I could think was "I'm going to remember maybe 5% of this, so keywords Maria remember keywords" after he was done he asked me "did you get it? I thought "tsconfig important, ts compiles into js, API fetch await enum" and replied "of course, thank you". I was 95% faith and 5% those words.

So my understanding of how this works now, after all the faith and some hardwork and many, many painkillers is that the API is how backends send information to frontends. this API contains information about Rick and Morty Episodes and characters, you can check exactly what through any online JSON formatter, that way you can get the keywords needed when fetching.

Await is important because APIs are not magical, they might take some time to respond. That's why Async is great.

So here's the info I could gather, presented the best way I could do it.

Now, the part I just finished and that I liked the most is, well, CSS. I like to call it Woodwork, because it's about things getting pretty. A few nails here and there, maybe some glue if you need it. Still not holding? good old tape is gotta do the work. I tried using webkit this time to style the scrollbars, I'm very happy about the results to be honest. 

I'm confident I'll get a better grasp of typescript working on the squad project. I must add that I'm often wrong, so please let me know whatever horrors you found here. I can take it, I promise I won't cry. too hard.

ISSUES

Well the first issue was... everything. I had no idea where to start, or how, or who. What is typescript? can I eat it?. Thanks to Alberto I had a starting point, So I checked, worked, consulted, and at the end, well, at least is working. right?

I had done some work during the holidays with APIs so I wasn't that lost there. Interfaces, though. INTERFACES. I'm still not sure how, or why, it's cool so I'M NOT GOING TO TOUCH IT. (I'm going to take a few courses when I can stand more screen time for sure)
